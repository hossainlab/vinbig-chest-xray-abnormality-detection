# VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection

This repository provides an implementation of deep learning models for detecting and localizing chest X-ray abnormalities using the **VinBigData** dataset. The goal is to classify and identify up to 14 types of thoracic abnormalities from chest radiographs.

## Dataset

The **VinBigData Chest X-ray** dataset contains labeled chest X-ray images for abnormality detection. The dataset includes bounding box annotations for 14 different abnormal conditions.
